# Halloween Quiz

## Introduction

I love Halloween and dress up as a witch almost every year. When I was learning about using JavaScript and jQuery together at Bloc, we had to design a quiz app. Therefore, I made this fun quiz application about Halloween Trivia. The score and question number are tracked at the top of the quiz. The quiz will let you know if your answer was right or wrong. Finally, the quiz can be restarted and taken as many times as you like. Please enjoy!

<strong>Technologies</strong>: JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Sass
